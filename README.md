# Xcode8ExtensionExample

An example of how to set up extensions in Xcode 8, and how to use the Darwin notification center to notify your Mac app that something has happened. 

Based on my iOS Dev UK / Pragma Conference 2016 talk "Escape From Alcatraz: The Brave New World Of Xcode Extensions."

Pragma Conference Slides (Mid Oct 2016): (coming soon!)
